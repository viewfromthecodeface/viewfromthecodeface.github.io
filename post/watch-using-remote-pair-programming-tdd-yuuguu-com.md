Related to the tutorial [How to do TDD with Java](https://www.viewfromthecodeface.com/how-to-write-a-tdd-unit-test-with-java/), this video from 2011 discusses how we used TDD with remote pair programming to build Yuuguu.

Whilst we chose not to follow XP style 'always paired', weÂ _did_ find that working together directly for some tasks paid off.

It's a brilliant way to get complementary experts actively working on the same problem at the same time.
